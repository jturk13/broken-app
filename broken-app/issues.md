# Broken App Issues

<!-- Missing Error Handling: There is no error handling in the code, which can lead to unhandled exceptions crashing the application. For example, if the GitHub API request fails, the application will crash.

Incorrect API Usage: The code might be using the GitHub API incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior. For example, it might not be handling rate limits properly or parsing the response JSON incorrectly.

Lack of Input Validation: The code does not validate the incoming request body to ensure it conforms to the expected format. This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior if the request body is malformed or missing required fields.

Code Structure: The code could be better organized and modularized to improve readability and maintainability. For example, separating the route handling logic from the main application logic can make the code easier to understand.

Security Concerns: The code might be vulnerable to security risks such as injection attacks or exposing sensitive information. For example, it might be directly passing user input to external APIs without proper validation or sanitization.

Error Messages: Error messages are not informative or user-friendly. They should provide enough information to help diagnose and fix the issue. -->
